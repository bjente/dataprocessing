In this folder you'll find my assignments for week 3. Next to the JSONconverter, I also added a cleandata.py program which I created because I wanted to clean up the database extracted from the following URL: https://data.world/moma/exhibitions. 
The output of this program is a cleaned CSV file which I use in my JSONconverter.
