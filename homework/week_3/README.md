In this folder you'll find my assignments for week 3. Next to the JSONconverter, I also added a cleandata.py program which I created because I wanted to clean up the database extracted from the following URL: https://data.world/moma/exhibitions. 
I decided for this particular assignment to not use the JSON converter, because I got in trouble with my index. Therefore, I converted my CSV file in the main function of cleandata.py, but this way of converting CSV to JSON (using pandas) works for me and it's a method which I can use for other assignments as well.
